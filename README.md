# ❤️ Heart Disease Classification

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various medical attributes.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a predictive model using Python and machine learning that can classify patients into `Heart Disease` or `No Heart Disease` based on clinical features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) (or mention your actual source)
- **Attributes Include**:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Chest pain type
  - Resting blood pressure
  - Cholesterol
  - Fasting blood sugar
  - ECG results
  - Maximum heart rate
  - Exercise-induced angina
  - ST depression
  - Target (Heart Disease: 0 or 1)
